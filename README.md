# Wardrobe-App Experiment

Project description 
------

An app to help people find clothes that match, which reduces time spent getting ready in the morning.

User Stories
------

MVP Interaction:

```
As a user,
I can select colours on the screen,
So I can see how they work together.

As a user,
I can see positive or negative feedback from the computer based on my decision,
So that I don't become a fashion victim.
```

Result
-----

We experimented building this in javascript, but in the end we decided to start again with rails and then add javascript once we had our minimum viable product.
